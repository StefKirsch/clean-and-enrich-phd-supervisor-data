# Clean and enrich PhD supervisor data

## Setup

1. **Clone or download your project** to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the project directory** in the terminal or command prompt.

3. **Create a virtual environment** within the project directory by running:
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv env
   ```
   This command creates a directory named `env` where the virtual environment files are stored.

4. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```sh
     source env/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```cmd
     .\env\Scripts\activate
     ```

5. **Install the dependencies** listed in your `requirements.txt` file by running:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. **Place raw data in `data/raw`** to run the notebook.
